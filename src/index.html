      Hi, I'm Chongyi Zheng,
    </p>
    <p class="mb-2">
      an undergraduate sophomore student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
      I am double majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science, expecting to graduate in May 2024.

    <h2 class="text-2xl mb-3">Highlighted Experience and Projects</h2>
    <p class="mb-2">
      Currently, I am working as a research assistant with Prof. Prasun Dewan at the Department of Computer Science at
      UNC Chapel Hill.
      The group is working on a project that generates programming hints for students when they are working on a
      programming assignment,
      using data-driven approaches.
      I am working on analyzing data from past programming assignments by constructing an Abstract Syntax Tree timeline.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-2">
      In fall 2021, I was an undergraduate teaching assistant in Systems Fundamentals (COMP 211), an intermediate course
      in the Department of Computer Science.
      The course focused on C programming, low-level system concepts, cache and memory management, and MIPS
      instructions.
      I held a daily office hours and graded students' lab assignments.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-2">
      In winter 2020-2021, I interned at Yunphant Blockchain, a company providing Blockchain as a Service solutions.
      I worked on chaincode editor, a tools that allows developers to write and test chaincode programs (the programs
      that runs on blockchain).
      I also ported the improved chaincode lifecycle to company's proprietary Yunphant Chain management system.

    <h2 class="text-2xl mb-3">Technical Skills</h2>
    <p class="mb-2">
      I use a variety of languages and tools in many different projects. C is the first language I learned since 2015. 
      I use Python for many small-scaled scripting works, and use Go for programs what will be packaged as containers.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-2">
      Here is the list of languages and tools I use:
