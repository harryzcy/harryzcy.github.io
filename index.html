I am double majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science, expecting to graduate in May 2024. </p> </section> <section id="highlights" class="m-auto max-w-[800px] py-5"> <h2 class="mb-3 text-2xl">Highlighted Experience and Projects</h2> <p class="mb-2"> Currently, I am working as a research assistant with Prof. Prasun Dewan at the Department of Computer Science at UNC Chapel Hill. The group is working on a project that generates programming hints for students when they are working on a programming assignment, using data-driven approaches. I am working on analyzing data from past programming assignments by constructing an Abstract Syntax Tree timeline. </p> <p class="mb-2"> In fall 2021, I was an undergraduate teaching assistant in Systems Fundamentals (COMP 211), an intermediate course in the Department of Computer Science. The course focused on C programming, low-level system concepts, cache and memory management, and MIPS instructions. I held a daily office hours and graded students' lab assignments. </p> <p class="mb-2"> In winter 2020-2021, I interned at Yunphant Blockchain, a company providing Blockchain as a Service solutions. I worked on chaincode editor, a tools that allows developers to write and test chaincode programs (the programs that runs on blockchain). I also ported the improved chaincode lifecycle to company's proprietary Yunphant Chain management system. </p> </section> </body></html>
