I am double majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science, expecting to graduate in May 2024. </p> </section> <section id="highlights" class="m-auto max-w-[800px] py-5"> <h2 class="mb-3 text-2xl">Highlighted Experience and Projects</h2> <p class="mb-2"> Currently, I am working as a research assistant with Prof. Prasun Dewan at the Department of Computer Science at UNC Chapel Hill. The group is working on a project that generates programming hints for students when they are working on a programming assignment, using data-driven approaches. I am working on analyzing data from past programming assignments by constructing an Abstract Syntax Tree timeline. </p> <p class="mb-2"> In fall 2021, I was an undergraduate teaching assistant in Systems Fundamentals (COMP 211), an intermediate course in the Department of Computer Science. The course focused on C programming, low-level system concepts, cache and memory management, and MIPS instructions. I held a daily office hours and graded students' lab assignments. </p> <p class="mb-2"> In winter 2020-2021, I interned at Yunphant Blockchain, a company providing Blockchain as a Service solutions. I worked on chaincode editor, a tools that allows developers to write and test chaincode programs (the programs that runs on blockchain). I also ported the improved chaincode lifecycle to company's proprietary Yunphant Chain management system. </p> </section> <section id="courseworks" class="m-auto max-w-[800px] py-5"> <h2 class="mb-3 text-2xl">Technical Skills</h2> <p class="mb-2"> I use a variety of languages and tools in many different projects. C is the first language I learned since 2015. I use Python for many small-scaled scripting works, and use Go for programs what will be packaged as containers. </p> <p class="mb-2"> Here is the list of languages and tools I use: </p> <div class="flex mb-2 mt-4"> <span class="flex-none pr-2 w-16"> <span class="font-bold">Strong</span>: </span> <span class="flex-1"> <span class="inline-block w-[85px]">Languages:</span> <span>Python, Golang</span> </span> </div> <div class="flex mb-2"> <span class="flex-none pr-2 w-16"> <span class="font-bold">Basic</span>: </span> <span class="flex-1"> <span class="inline-block w-[85px]">Languages:</span> <span>C, SQL, Java, JavaScript/TypeScript, HTML, CSS</span> <span class="block w-full"></span> <span class="inline-block w-[85px]">Tools:</span> <span>Docker, Git, React.js, Node.js, Postgres, MySQL, SQLite</span> </span> </div> <div class="flex mb-2"> <span class="flex-none pr-2 w-16"> <span class="font-bold">Some</span>: </span> <span class="flex-1"> <span class="inline-block w-[85px]">Languages:</span> <span>Rust, Matlab, Bash, Lisp</span> <span class="block w-full"></span> <span class="inline-block w-[85px]">Tools:</span> <span>Make, Kubernetes, Vue.js, Parcel, MongoDB</span> </span> </div> </section> </body></html>
